# Lab 2: Implementing integration between AD DS and Azure AD

## Scenario

To address concerns regarding management and monitoring overhead resulting from using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to authenticate and authorize access to Azure resources, you decide to test integration between on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and Azure AD to verify that this will address business concerns about managing multiple user accounts by using a mix of on-premises and cloud resources.

Additionally, you want to make sure that your approach addresses the Information Security team's concerns and preserves existing controls applied to Active Directory users, such as sign-in hours and password policies. Finally, you want to identify Azure AD integration features that allow you to further enhance on-premises Active Directory security and minimize its management overhead, including Azure AD Password Protection for Windows Server Active Directory and Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) with password writeback.

Your goal is to implement pass-through authentication between on-premises AD DS and Azure AD.

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-800%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Implementing%20integration%20between%20AD%20DS%20and%20Azure%20AD)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same. 

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Prepare Azure AD for integration with on-premises AD DS, including adding and verifying a custom domain.
- Prepare on-premises AD DS for integration with Azure AD, including running IdFix DirSync Error Remediation Tool.
- Install and configure Azure AD Connect.
- Verify integration between AD DS and Azure AD by testing the synchronization process.
- Implementing Azure AD integration features in Active Directory, including Azure AD Password Protection for Windows Server Active Directory and SSPR with password writeback.

## Estimated timing: 60 minutes

## Lab setup

Virtual machines: **AZ-800T00A-SEA-DC1**, **AZ-800T00A-SEA-SVR1**, and **AZ-800T00A-ADM1** must be running. Other VMs can be running, but they aren't required for this lab.

1. Under **Password**, select the **Auto generate** checkbox. Record the password as you'll use it later in this lab.
1. Select **Next:Properties>**
1. Under **settings** in the **Usage location** drop-down list, select **United States**.
1. Select **Next:Assignments>**
1. Under **Assignments** tab , select **+ Add role** and on **Directory roles** page, from the list of roles, select **Global administrator**, and then select **Select**.
